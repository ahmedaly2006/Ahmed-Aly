üß© PART 1 ‚Äì Imports, Constants, and Decorator
In Part 1, I set up the core utilities for the program.

I import essential libraries: os for file operations, typing for type hints, wraps for decorators, and pyttsx3 for speech.

Then, I define ANSI color codes to allow colored terminal output.

Lastly, I create a reusable decorator color_output that prints any function‚Äôs output in the specified color. This improves the CLI's visual experience.

üìÑ PART 2 ‚Äì Base File Reader Class
This is the foundational class: FileReader.

It allows reading and writing of text files.

The lines property makes working with content easier, like a list.

It supports file merging using + and multiple file concatenation.

Lastly, the display() method uses the blue-colored decorator for printing file content in the terminal.
thats why when I display the content is displayed in blue

üìä PART 3 ‚Äì LineStatsFileReader (Subclass)
This class extends FileReader with analysis features.

It adds line_count() and word_count() methods to calculate basic statistics.

When merging files, it includes a header that notes which files were combined.

It overrides __str__() to return a summary including filepath, number of lines, and words.

üîä PART 4 ‚Äì SpeakingFileReader (Subclass)
This subclass adds text-to-speech.

It initializes a pyttsx3 engine in the constructor.

The speak() method reads a string aloud.

The display_and_speak() method prints each line and speaks it, combining both visual and audio interaction.

It‚Äôs especially useful for accessibility or audio-based reading of files.

üñ•Ô∏è PART 5 ‚Äì Command-Line Interface (CLI)
This is the user-facing part of the program.

A menu is presented with options to create, read, merge, analyze, and speak files.

Each option is linked to logic that uses the appropriate class (LineStatsFileReader, SpeakingFileReader, etc.).

All readers are stored in memory in a dictionary, making it easy to access them by name.


pytest
---------------
This test, test_add_two_readers, verifies that the + operator correctly merges two LineStatsFileReader instances:

Creates two temporary files using tmp_path.

Writes content to each using from_text().

Merges them using the + operator, which includes a custom header.

Asserts that the result is an instance of LineStatsFileReader.

Checks that the merged file contains exactly 4 lines:
‚Üí 2 header lines + 2 content lines.

evaluating and improving
pylint
---------------
Code quality is essential for readability and collaborating, I used Pylint, a widely adopted static code analysis tool, to evaluate and improve the overall quality of the codebase.
Pylint analyzes the code and assigns a score based on several key factors, including:

Code style consistency (PEP8 compliance, indentation, line length)

Proper use of docstrings and comments

Detection of unused or redundant code

Cyclomatic complexity (e.g. too many branches/statements in one function)

Readability and best practices
and to develope my code i made a few things , like having a well-organized code, adding comments, remove the unnecessary parts

To improve the score, I made targeted enhancements:

Ensured the code is organized and well-structured

Added clear docstrings and in-line comments

Removed ineffective statements


Read/write text files using a unified interface
- Get line and word counts with `LineStatsFileReader`
- Text-to-speech support via `pyttsx3`
- Colored CLI output using decorators and ANSI codes
- Merge multiple files seamlessly
